# TODO: Create Full Male Streetwear Webshop

## Tasks
- [x] Ensure all dark theme pages (index.html, products.html, cart.html, inspect.html) are fully responsive for mobile and desktop
- [x] Remove any questionable content from product names, images, or descriptions
- [x] Add missing functionalities to make it a complete webshop (e.g., backend product management if needed)
- [x] Update navigation to focus on male products only
- [x] Test full webshop flow: browse products, add to cart, checkout, contact
- [x] Ensure server.js handles all necessary endpoints (register, contact, cart persistence if added)

## Notes
- Dark theme pages: index.html (home), products.html (product list), cart.html (cart), inspect.html (product details)
- All pages already have mobile responsiveness with @media queries
- Products are streetwear: hoodies, joggers, zip-ups with dark, bold designs
- No questionable content in current products (e.g., "Eclipse Veil Zip-Up", "Stellar Shadow Zip-Up")
- Server.js has contact and register endpoints; cart is localStorage-based
- Webshop is complete with authentication, cart, checkout simulation
